# Clock_For_Arms âŒšðŸ’ª

Horo was just a regular teenager. He had caring friends, a loving family, and great school grades. However, there was one problem: he was always late.

Horo was late so much that his fellow peers started bullying him, calling him names such as "Last Minute Larry" or "Horo-late." Eventually, his peers became more violent and began using clocks as weapons against him. Whenever Horo walked towards the school gates, he was pelted with hundreds of clocks by everyone around, including the teachers who hated Horo's poor punctuality.

After several years of constant bullying and torture, Horo began to notice some supernatural changes in his arms. Despite this, Horo received no help and remained silent about it for 12 years.

Then, on his 24th birthday, he reflected on the impact of the abuse by hundreds of people with clocks on his health. After thinking about the truly horrific results, he sought vengeance and wanted to go on a bloodthirsty killing spree against all those who mistreated him as a child.

With his new abilities, he begins the search for those who treated him unjustly.
