# Clock_For_Arms âŒšðŸ’ª

Horo, an ordinary teenager with benevolent friends, a loving family, and excellent academic performance, had one irksome issue: he was chronically tardy. His habitual lateness became a catalyst for relentless bullying from his peers, who resorted to pelting him with clocks, using them as weapons. In a cruel twist of fate, even the teachers who loathed Horo's poor punctuality partook in the barrage of clock throwing. The ceaseless bullying and torture he endured for years inflicted profound physical and psychic damage, yet no one offered him aid or solace. As time went on, Horo began to notice extraordinary, supernatural changes in his arms, yet he remained silent about it for a dozen years. On his twenty-fourth birthday, Horo contemplated the profound effects of being abused by an army of clock-wielding tormentors on his wellbeing. In the aftermath of this painful reflection, he craved retribution and vowed to embark on a bloodthirsty killing spree against all those who had mistreated him. With his newfound powers, Horo set out on a mission to seek out and punish those who had unjustly wronged him.
